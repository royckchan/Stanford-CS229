# Stanford-CS229

*** Updates (20220417) ***

To comply with [Stanford's teaching policy](https://github.com/royckchan/Stanford-CS229/issues/1), I have removed the assignment solutions from this repo.

Andrew Ng's Stanford CS229 (Machine Learning) course materials - http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

I store all the course materials of Stanford CS229 for Autumn 2017, which include (i) class notes, (ii) discussion section notes, (iii) supplementary notes, (iv) problem sets (including datasets, Python starter codes, and original .zip or .tgz files), and (v) my own (non-official) solutions to problem sets. All the programming assignments are done in Python.

Roughly speaking, I put them into different folders in the following way:
Assignments - contains (iv) problem sets, and (v) solutions;
Lecture Notes - contains (i) class notes;
Tutorial Notes - contains (ii) discussion section notes, and (iii) supplementary notes.
